	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Models: Resolve "copy_properties" references in model definitions.
	  This makes CalaSR and CalaBerbel work.

	* Models: Allow assigning Roon output method IDs to audio sinks. This
	  is required for Roon certification.

	* Models: Support choice of value mapping for Roon depending on the
	  setting of a control. This allows suppression or change of value
	  mapping type, depending on values of a control (currently used for
	  tone control enable/disable).

	* Documentation: Mention DCP register 82 and the AuPaL compiler.
