2021-06-28  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* Roon: Support audio paths across multiple devices. The configuration
	  database supported this already, but the Roon plugin was unable to
	  cope with such a setting.

	* Roon: Fix audio path caching.

	* Models: Add description for MP200HA. This device does not exist, but
	  it models two physical appliances as a single one. It was introduced
	  to work around the previous lack of support for compound appliances.

2019-09-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Models: Resolve "copy_properties" references in model definitions.
	  This makes CalaSR and CalaBerbel work.

	* Models: Allow assigning Roon output method IDs to audio sinks. This
	  is required for Roon certification.

	* Models: Support choice of value mapping for Roon depending on the
	  setting of a control. This allows suppression or change of value
	  mapping type, depending on values of a control (currently used for
	  tone control enable/disable).

	* Documentation: Mention DCP register 82 and the AuPaL compiler.

2019-06-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>
