	* Misc: Maintenance work.

2022-09-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.8 released.

	* Misc: Several minor fixes in shared code.

2021-08-20  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Roon: Fix MP 200 model according to Roon certification report.

	* Roon: Improve the "select" mapping type so that it works with range
	  parameters, not only choice parameters.

	* Roon: Add value mapping type "const" which translates the input in a
	  "select"-type mapping table into a constant value.

	* Roon: Add two new mappings for translating values reported by
	  appliance into values to be reported to Roon.

	  One of these new mappings is "const_table" which is a simplified
	  version of "select". Its mapping table is a plain array of values,
	  indexed by the selected parameter.

	  The other is "balance_slider" which is a specialized mapping just
	  for balance sliders. It transforms signed integers into strings such
	  as "L4" or "R31".

2021-07-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.6 released.

	* Roon: Fix reporting of certain audio path changes.

2021-06-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.5 released.

	* Models: Update description for MP200HA and rename it to MP200.

2021-06-28  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* Roon: Support audio paths across multiple devices. The configuration
	  database supported this already, but the Roon plugin was unable to
	  cope with such a setting.

	* Roon: Fix audio path caching.

	* Models: Add description for MP200HA. This device does not exist, but
	  it models two physical appliances as a single one. It was introduced
	  to work around the previous lack of support for compound appliances.

2020-08-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.3 released.

	* Build system: Support Meson.

	* Logging: Improved some error messages during value updates.

	* Unit tests: Improved error messages for unexpected log messages
	  emitted by the implementation under test.

	* Misc: Modernizations and minor fixes.

2019-09-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Models: Resolve "copy_properties" references in model definitions.
	  This makes CalaSR and CalaBerbel work.

	* Models: Allow assigning Roon output method IDs to audio sinks. This
	  is required for Roon certification.

	* Models: Support choice of value mapping for Roon depending on the
	  setting of a control. This allows suppression or change of value
	  mapping type, depending on values of a control (currently used for
	  tone control enable/disable).

	* Documentation: Mention DCP register 82 and the AuPaL compiler.

2019-06-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.1 released.

	* First release for testing. Proper tracking of signal path changes
	  and support for Roon are already included.
